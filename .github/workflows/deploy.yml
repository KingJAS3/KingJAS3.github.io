# deploy.yml — GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying to GitHub Pages.
#
# GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) system
# that automatically runs jobs when things happen to your repository.
#
# This workflow:
#   1. Triggers on every push to the "main" branch
#   2. Installs dependencies
#   3. Runs the parser (prebuild) + builds the React app (vite build)
#   4. Uploads the dist/ folder as a Pages artifact
#   5. Deploys it to GitHub Pages at kingjas3.github.io
#
# SETUP REQUIRED (one time, in GitHub):
#   Settings → Pages → Source → "GitHub Actions"
#   Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions"

      # 4. Build the app
      #    This runs: prebuild (process-jbook.js) → vite build → writes dist/
      #    Note: The fy2026_budget/ data folder must be committed to the repo,
      #    or an alternative step must download it before building.
