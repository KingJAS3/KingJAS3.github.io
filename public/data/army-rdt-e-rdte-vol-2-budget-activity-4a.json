FY 2025 Plans: Conduct DT$amp;amp;E to modernize fleet-wide foodservice operations aboard submarines, by optimizing refrigeration/storage, modernizing foodservice equipment assets, and reducing Sailor workload; initiate prototype fabrication of modular, scalable field feeding platforms in support of USMC Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), addressing the needs of platoon through battalion field feeding requirements; deliver standardized Food Service Management (FSM) ready menu items in support of Navy Standard Core Menu (NSCM). FY 2026 Plans: Will procure and integrate components into a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) trailer-based field feeding prototype for USMC Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) initiatives, incorporating true multi-fuel capability, man-transportability, power independence, and the capability to feed at the company level; Will complete the fabrication of modular, scalable field feeding platforms in support of USMC EABO, will conduct Contractor Testing, Developmental Testing, and begin Limited User Evaluations; Will initiate validation and re-assessment of life cycle expectancy for Navy Food Service Equipment items and provide overall phased replacement schedules; Will develop and test menus/unique recipes for the Navy Standard Core Menu (NSCM) to support Navy ships during times of disrupted communication - changes will reduce menu items, reduce shipboard freezer and chill space needs, and increase shelf stable storage, thus reducing resupply frequency.

Project supports development and testing of medical products and equipment for deployable forces providing future interoperability of systems on the battlefield and situational awareness of Soldier well-being. Project supports enhancements to Soldier battlefield effectiveness, survivability, and sustainment. This project also supports joint medical field systems and prolonged combat casualty care requirements. FY 2025 Plans: Division Medical Mobile Shelter (DMMS): Begin evaluating commercial infrastructure equipment and development of DMMS. Blast Overpressure Sensor System (BOSS): develop a sensing capability to collect blast overpressure (BOP) data from soldiers. FY 2026 Plans: Mobile Medical Platforms and Shelters (formerly Division Medical Mobile Shelter (DMMS)): Continue development support and analysis of Medical Device component integration into Mobile platforms and shelters. Blast Overpressure Sensor System (BOSS): Progress in developing a sensing capability to collect blast overpressure (BOP) data from soldiers. Monitoring capability that will collect, integrate, store, and transmit BOP exposure data within the Army enterprise and DoD information system databases to provide a longitudinal record of BOP exposures to aide in understanding and tracking potential long-term health consequences of repeated BOP exposure.

FY 2025 Plans: The VS4 project will build on previously developed Technology/Maturation and risk reduction efforts across the PPE portfolio to support SPS requirements. The project will facilitate the exploration and optimization of alternative materials for use against emerging Vital Torso Protection threats. The project will explore other technologies such as higher performing ballistic defeating materials and new construction methods to address weight reduction and emerging threats. This project will facilitate test method refinement and improve surveillance testing capabilities to update lifecycle estimates, refine risk injury criteria, and continue mass reduction.

Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Autonomy Formations prototype development supports existing and future robotic capabilities by mitigating risk associated with enabling capabilities such as the common architecture, communications and network capabilities and mitigation of safety risks hindering operational employment. In addition to ground platforms, autonomous formations will be integrated with UAS, enablers, and a variety of payloads from existing capability sets or developed and transitioned to future robotic and autonomous capability portfolios.

FY 2025 to FY 2026 Increase/Decrease Statement: Increase in funding from FY 2025 to FY 2026 is due to the Army Transformation Initiative streamlining systems in the Robotics portfolio.","pdfc_1":"-","pdfc_2":null,"pdfc_3":8.266}},{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Accomplishments/Planned Programs

The IFPCHPM is a weapon system that can be transported by common brigade combat team equipment to defend fixed and semi-fixed sites against Group 1-2 UAS swarms. IFPC-HPM is common with other Services and the Joint Counter-UAS Office (JCO) HPM effectors for countering UAS. IFPC-HPM leverages previous HPM technology demonstrations and facilitates continued operational assessment. FY 2025 Plans: Will support issuance of the residual combat capability to a unit, new threat target software updates, and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) which facilitates continued operational assessment and a potential future transition to an acquisition program. FY 2026 Plans: FY 2026 funds will support evaluation, demonstration and assessment for employed systems; to include the addition of up to two (2) Generation 2 systems; continue CONUS/OCONUS CLS; and prepare for a potential transition of prototype technologies to an acquisition program.

FY 2025 Plans: Establish a program office, initiate program management functions, initiate system design and development, purchase long lead items, and commence prototype fabrication. FY 2026 Plans: Gaps resulting from the SCO Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System (HGWS) effort include the current design does not meet all necessary functional performance requirements (SCO's or Army's), including systems engineering, cybersecurity, electronic protection, reliability, or survivability. The current HGWS prime items have no established or validated allocated requirements, are not integrated on tactical mobility platforms, and will be delivered with ICDs that are not fully implemented (defined only). This effort will continue prototype development by re-baselining and finalizing designs through technical reviews, including component qualification; purchasing the remaining prototype material, to include tactical vehicles for each subsystem, purchasing or fabricating the testing consumables necessary for cannon and projectile development and safety testing, initiating developmental and safety test planning, and initiating hardware and software integration and testing; and completing qualification of all prime items. Additionally, continue Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) integration, test and verify subsystem software and performance against threats through the use of Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) and Modeling and Simulations (M$amp;amp;S), and further planning efforts for New Equipment Training (NET), Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT$amp;amp;E) and the Operational Assessment (OA). FY 2025 Accomplishments: A program office was established, program management functions were initiated, and system design and development efforts were initiated. Market research to support Other Transaction Authority for Prototyping (OTAP) contracts for the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon/Hypervelocity Projectile (MDAC/HVP) and Multi-Function Precision Radar (MFPR) was completed and the program office began developing the contract packages. .
