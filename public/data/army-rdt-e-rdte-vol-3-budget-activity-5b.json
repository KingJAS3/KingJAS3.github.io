By moving beyond compliance-based cybersecurity, the CRCF supports both materiel and non-materiel solutions, ensuring the Army can outpace sophisticated threats from malicious actors and nation-state competitors.

These efforts are based on requests to address discovered and enumerated findings from DoD Strategic Cybersecurity Program, Defense Cyber Red Teams, other Defensive Cyberspace Operations, and other assessments. Each specific request (classified) is verified as operationally-relevant and threat-informed. The Office of the ASA(ALT) will oversee execution of specific (classified) efforts, while analyzing urgent, emergent requests for potential reprioritization. The Office will all continue coordination with programs, operational stakeholders, and the intelligence community to capture proposed remediation effort for future year execution. FY 2026 Plans: Converged Business System Defenses. The Converged Business System Defenses initiative addresses inconsistent monitoring across ABS, particularly at the application layer. This effort will accelerate the convergence of disparate Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) solutions across Program Executive Offices (PEOs), delivering initial application-level monitoring and analysis capabilities. Validated by the CIO, this initiative will reduce contract duplication costs and improve the Army's ability to detect and respond to cyber threats. By integrating actionable intelligence and enhancing monitoring, this effort is critical to safeguarding Army business systems and ensuring operational continuity. Software Readiness. The Software Readiness initiative will address manual and disparate software delivery processes across PEOs by scaling automated software management and delivery. This effort will onboard programs into the DSO pipeline and software repository for patch storage and delivery, improving visibility and readiness. Operational units will be notified of updates through MIM/MAM, ensuring timely patching and enhanced software reliability. This initiative is essential for maintaining the Army's software systems in a state of readiness to meet operational demands. Formal Methods for Secure Code. The Formal Methods (FM) for Secure Code effort will enhance software assurance by leveraging advanced tools and processes to address threats that traditional methods cannot pace. With DARPA's investment and initial pilots for IBCS/CRS and CECOM software pipelines, this initiative will deliver improved security solutions for Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capabilities. By introducing $amp;quot;context-aware$amp;quot; software assurance methods, the Army will strengthen its ability to counter sophisticated cyber threats and ensure the resilience of critical systems. This effort is vital to maintaining the security and integrity of Army software platforms in an increasingly contested cyber environment.","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col

The PPDS enables distribution of power from prime power sources which use medium voltages or higher. The system will transform medium or higher voltages down to standard 120/208 V, 3-phase power. Elements of the PPDS will enhance the existing PSC and SDC by incorporating advanced capabilities to accept either 4160 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) primary input power from a USA Deployable Power Generation and Distribution System (DPGDS) or a USAF Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) power source or 13.8kVAC from contracted and commercial power sources or host nation/existing distribution systems. Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK) effort renamed to Prime Power Distribution Systems (PPDS) in FY 2024. FY 2025 Plans: Prime effort would be continuing the Prime Power Distribution Systems (PPDS) prototype build/test components and start developmental testing inclusive of the Improved Primary Switching Center (iPSC), Improved Secondary Distribution Center (iSDC) V-1 $amp;amp; V-2, and Tactical Prime Power Transformer (TPPT). FY 2026 Base Plans: Funding to support prototype development completion and developmental testing of iPSC, iSDC and TPPT. FY 2025 to FY 2026 Increase/Decrease Statement: Increase in funding from FY 2025 to FY 2026 reflects continued requirements for PPDS prototype developmental and to initiate developmental testing efforts of iPSC, iSDC and TPPT.

The STEP program will consist of two major lines of effort providing three distinct power generating and power storage capabilities. These systems will be approached along lines of effort that associate with a system; STEP 3kW will provide power generation and the STEP Hybrid Augmentation Systems (STEP HAS) will be an add-on for both systems that will provide energy storage. The STEP program is a critical enabler to the Army modernization priorities under Army Futures Command Soldier Lethality Cross Function Team (CFT) and Network CFT. It will be power sources for Soldier borne sensors, lasers and optics. FY 2025 Plans: FY 2025 funds support the continuation of the STEP 3kW development contract.

The program produces approved and tested standard shelter designs to support procurements by materiel developers and Program Managers (PMs) requiring rigid wall shelters. Once developed and formally type-classified, ASF-RWS shelter procurements are customer-funded by PMs as a cost under their program(s).

FY 2025 Plans: Funds continue MMC-T software/systems engineering and completes development of the BFT-3 capability under the BFT-3 transceiver and encryption device development contracts. Efforts include the integration of the BFT modular waveform, that will enable competition by allowing third-party transceiver manufacturers to access and interoperate with the existing BFT network (including the BFT SNCC and SGS); integration of a resilient line of sight waveform on a software defined radio; and integration of the transceiver and encryption devices to each mounted platform. Funding will also support initial BFT Aviation variant development activities. Funds continue to support MMC-S software/systems engineering and development utilizing a CI/CD approach with new capability development and convergence with third-party apps and WfF apps on a quarterly cadence. Platform development will focus on supporting platform sensor interfaces. Engineering efforts will complete integration with the MMC-T encryption device.
