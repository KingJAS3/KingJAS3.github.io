This scalable solution supports both on premise and cloud deployments and continuously monitors user entity behavior to identify potential insider threats. Using an agile backlog structured into strategic epics and supported by continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, UAM proactively detects and mitigates risks associated with the theft or misuse of mission essential data. Data collected by distributed UAM modules is funneled into a centralized Insider Threat Hub for real time analysis and rapid action. FY 2025 Plans: Prior to the BA8 Pilot Program, UAM was funded under RDT&E (PE 0605041A EV5) as an initial minimum viable product. FY 2025 funding accelerates software modernization through agile releases, delivering on-demand CI/CD releases that include security updates, patching, and software license management. Additionally, agile efforts support iterative enhancements across all classified networks as directed by HQDA EXORD 344-23 while developing, testing, accrediting, and integrating the GOTS UAM Viper Endpoint Collection Tool and Persona User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) applications. This approach enables a smooth transition to a fully self sustaining GOTS UAM-Cloud platform, gradually reducing reliance on commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions as Viper is deployed, increasing rapid development based on operational needs, and supports agile upgrades to the UAM Special Access Program (SAP). FY 2026 Plans: FY 2026 funding will expand UAM deployment across classified networks, driven by prioritized capacity needs and risk assessments. It also funds the initial capacity development for integrated artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) enhancements. Specifically, funding will further enhance AI/ML capabilities, advancing user entity behavior analytics through predictive models and automated anomaly detection. These agile enhancements enable rapid, on-demand CI/CD releases that improve threat detection and mitigation within UAM Viper and Persona UEBA applications.
