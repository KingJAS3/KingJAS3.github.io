HMIF formations will include ground and air systems and enablers to aid in the human decision-making process to find, fix and engage enemy targets. RCCTO HMIF prototype development supports existing and future robotic capabilities by mitigating risk associated with enabling capabilities such as the common architecture, communications and network capabilities and mitigation of safety risks hindering operational employment.

This includes integration of multi-service technology and upgrades to the BOC, launchers, reload trailers, support vehicles, and associated equipment necessary to deliver and sustain fully operational prototype systems. The program activities align with Army mission focused priorities for multi-domain, joint operations and readiness. Investments focus on technology development and system engineering efforts including, but are not limited to technologies to enhance survivability, operability, reliability, and performance of personnel in a threat environment. FY 2025 Plans: The FY 2025 Base funding in the amount of $182.823 million funds the fabrication, integration of design requirements, and test and evaluation for the Mid-Range Capabilities (MRC) Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and to enable completion and fielding of the prototype Battery 3. Base funding allows for integration of design requirements and evaluation of MRC GSE required characteristics to ensure safe and effective operational fielding of the prototype Batteries 3 and 4. Funds the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) effort to purchase hardware and materials and receive Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to fabricate and to support component-level and system-level qualification for MRC GSE. Base funding also allows for the System Engineering and Program Management of integration across military branches to include the OEM contractor and Other Government Agencies (OGA) in order to ensure a common MRC GSE. Funding provides for the Government and Contractor coordination required to perform systems engineering for system integration and check out, verify cybersecurity requirements, manage software development, verify transportation requirements, and plan and execute test and evaluation events to support fielding. This funding allows for developing, testing, evaluating, systems engineering and integrating of system improvements while ensuring safe, suitable and sustainable operational fielding of the MRC GSE solution through Weapon System Modifications (WSM) adding additional capabilities to the prototype batteries. Additional integration efforts include improved communications, rapid reloading, improved mobility, weight reduction, M-Code implementation, software development, cyber security, transportability and locality-based enhancements. Provides Systems Engineering and Government Program Management required to deliver the prototype battery to a combat unit. FY 2026 Plans: FY 2026 Base funding in the amount of $186.304 million continues all aspects of developing MRC technology upgrades. Provides prototype systems with iterative survivability, reliability, and operational effectiveness improvements based on evolving system requirement to ensure operational effectiveness. Base funding allows for continued development of system improvements utilizing evaluation, design, prototyping, testing, engineering, configuration management, component and system-level qualification activities, operational demonstrations, operator/maintainer training development, and integration of all functional support to ensure operational safety and effectiveness of all fielded and in-development systems meet performance needs.","pdfc_1":255.121,"pdfc_2":182.823,"pdfc_3":186.304}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"millions"},{"name":"Table 454","tabPath":["Table 454"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"Exhibit R-2A, RDT$amp;amp;E Project Justification: PB 2026 Army","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col 1","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"Date: June 2025","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Appropriation/Budget Activity 2040 / 5","pdfc_1":"R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605235A / Strategic Mid-Range Capabi lity","pdfc_2":"Project (Number/Name) CQ4 / Mid-Range Capability"}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"thousands"},{"name":"Table 455","tabPath":["Table 455"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"Base funding also allows for the system engineering and program management of Army ground launch requirements to include the original equipment manufacturer and other government agencies to ensure a common MRC GSE across all batteries.

Agile software development continues to support enduring development efforts and includes software fixes and improvements to counter emerging threats and incorporate emerging technology. Funding supports IBCS agile software development and integration, developmental and operational testing and requirements verification of the software build, operational testing, and integration activities for integrated fires capabilities. It also expands software factory development capacity to enable multiple 1-N capability items to be worked concurrently as defined by emerging joint Warfighter priorities. Funding provided for integration of additional Post-IOC 1-N capabilities such as: Sentinel A4, RIG-360, Army Long Range Persistent Surveillance (ALPS), F-35 Joint Striker and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). In addition, funding provides for the continuation of the Software Integration Facility (SWIF) a Government-Owned, Government-Operated software development, integration, and test capability.
