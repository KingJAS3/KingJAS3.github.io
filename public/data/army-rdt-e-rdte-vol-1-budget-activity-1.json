Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools have the potential to find useful information in these data, but they need to be able to effectively communicate this to human decision makers, staffs, and operators. This research focuses on the interaction of human and AI systems, especially in high-stakes environments with complex tasks and high uncertainty. As components of this, the research investigates how to make AI more understandable to humans, how to evaluate the outputs of AI and ML, the safety of interactions between humans and robotic or AI systems, how AI and ML impact decision-making, how to effectively integrate AI into current Army processes, how to train users at various technical skill-levels to interact more effectively with AI and ML, how to use AI and ML to process and summarize large amounts of data for human consumption, and how to ethically apply AI to decision making. FY 2025 Plans: Research human and non-human behavior and interactions in various online social settings. Extend current research on effective occupational training in artificial intelligence and machine learning for an audience with diverse technical skills to improve the Army's capability to deploy and use AI/ML products. Research methods for making machine learning output more interpretable for human consumption and the effects these techniques have on human decision making. FY 2026 Plans: Will extend research on human and non-human behavior and interactions in various online social settings; research effective occupational training in artificial intelligence and machine learning for an audience with diverse technical skills to improve the Army's capability to deploy and use AI/ML products; expand research methods for making machine learning output more interpretable for human consumption and the effects these techniques have on human decision making; research the use of quantitative metrics in measuring the ethical compliance of AI systems; expand research in novel algorithms for improving human decision-making.
