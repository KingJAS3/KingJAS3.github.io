The SDR-based radar systems have been employed mainly in military operations, like target detection, target recognition, surveillance, and other specific applications, such as meteorology and air traffic control. However, in recent years, large-scale commercial applications are driving standard radar system operations at significant cost reductions with increased adaptability. Therefore, Software Defined Radar (SDRadar) represents new challenges in radar technology given the possibility of performing basic operations (i.e. mixing, filtering, modulation, and demodulation) by simply employing software modules to eliminate much of the radar specific processing hardware. The main goal of a software defined approach is related not only to a clear cost reduction, but also to a significant increase of the versatility of the system, since signal generation and signal processing parameters may be easily adapted to the task under consideration. Integration into test and training range and Home Station networks, such as the Threat Battle Command Force, provides significant Integrated Air Defense Systems capability utilizing multiple units. This program supports U.S. Army acquisition ability to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing both Developmental and Operational Tests, as well as Live, Virtual, and Constructive training. The low-cost systems emulate known threat radars across multiple radar bands and develop as many emitters as possible to create a dense, RF environment. FY 2025 Plans: Provide threat emitters to support Developmental and Operational Tests across multiple Army Test and Training programs. In addition, units will be deployed at Combined Training Centers as well as to various Army installations in support of Home Station Training in a Live, Virtual and Constructive environment.

This body of work will examine relationships between related harmful behaviors and will identify methods to enhance Army leaders' abilities to (1) build protective environments, (2) reduce tolerance for harmful behaviors, and (3) facilitate access to services. Additionally, future research will identify patterns of behaviors shared by sexual offenders in the military context and will evaluate strategies to prevent and respond to sexual assault. FY 2026 funding will support the development and validation of tools, training, and organizational structures that contribute to reductions in harmful behaviors and enhance positive outcomes across the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development). FY 2025 to FY 2026 Increase/Decrease Statement: FY26 decrease of 3K due to economic assumptions.","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col 1","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"FY 2024","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_3","label":"FY 2025","type":"numeric"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals","pdfc_1":"1.208","pdfc_2":1.179,"pdfc_3":1.176}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"millions"},{"name":"Exhibit R-2A","tabPath":["Exhibit R-2A"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"COST ($ in Millions)","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Prior Years","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"FY 2024","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_3","label":"FY 2025","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_4","label":"FY 2026 Base","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_5","label":"FY 2026 OOC","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_6","label":"FY 2026 Total","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_7","label":"FY 2027","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_8","label":"FY 2028","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_9","label":"FY 2029","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_10","label":"FY 2030","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_11","label":"Cost To Complete","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_12","label":"Total Cost","type":"numeric"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"M65: Army Test and Evaluation Command","pdfc_1":null,"pdfc_2":54.289,"pdfc_3":58.548,"pdfc_4":52.26,"pdfc_5":null,"pdfc_6":52.26,"pdfc_7":null,"pdfc_8":null,"pdfc_9":null,"pdfc_10":null,"pdfc_11":null,"pdfc_12":null}},{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Quantity of RDT$amp;amp;E Articles","pdfc_1":null,"pdfc_2":null,"pdfc_3":null,"pdfc_4":null,"pdfc_5":null,"pdfc_6":null,"pdfc_7":null,"pdfc_8":null,"pdfc_9":null,"pdfc_10":null,"pdfc_11":null,"pdfc_12":null}}],"totalRows":2,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"millions"},{"name":"Table 360","tabPath":["Table 360"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"B.

The Program uses Scalable Agile Framework (SAFe) SW development methodology in the digital engineering environment. SAFe is a scalable and configurable framework that guides incremental development of software and rapid development of functional capabilities within the IBCS to continuously address evolving threats. Each program increment (PI) is comprised of four Sprints. There are four PIs annually which culminate in the release of a yearly Minimum Viable Capability Release (MVCR). In this construct, capability to address the user needs and requirements are developed and refined in each successive PI, allowing for the continuous delivery and fielding of new and/or improved functional capabilities. Through Agile methods, the IFMC PO will provide the Warfighter with 1-N capabilities faster and with minimal re-work due to Warfighter feedback from requirement implementation to final product testing and deployment.

CORA-P addresses the requirements of Section 1502 of the FY24 NDAA, which directed the Services to harmonize the identification and mitigation cyberspace vulnerabilities in critical weapon systems. Headquarters, Department of the Army initially established CORA-P to continue Section 1647 assessments, while expanding to include supply chain risk analysis and electromagnetic spectrum vulnerabilities. CORA-P has since shifted from executing new assessments to harmonizing defensive efforts across existing Army and DoD assessment programs (including the Strategic Cybersecurity Program). CORA-P now focuses on developing and delivering vulnerability remediations that result from these assessments as well as from sensitive threat intelligence and other potential indicators of compromise. Activities include improving the structure and visibility of vulnerability data to improve portfolio risk management, initiating remediation efforts for high-priority, crosscutting issues, and avoiding future risks by driving improvements earlier in materiel development for modernization programs. As part of CORA-P, the Army identifies and prioritizes capabilities most-relevant to National Defense Strategy priorities based on input from mission planning, JROC guidance, and sensitive threat intelligence. This also includes coordinating Army Cyber Command lead Crisis Action Teams, where specific vulnerabilities affect the Army weapon/business systems. A key aspect is integrating efforts across both HQDA and Army Commands to understand total risk exposure while avoiding duplication. The Army then reviews the security posture of these critical components, develops remediation strategies, and facilitates delivery of fixes at mission-relevant speed. This includes working with program offices, capability managers, and resource managers to develop realistic plans of action for manage risk across outyears, and then gaining Army Senior Leader approval as needed. CORA-P ensures Army cyberspace remediation investments address areas of highest operational risk. FY 2025 Plans: The funding provides the Army the opportunity to assure its digital transformation through automation to improve efficiency and effectiveness of cyber vulnerability collection, analysis, and reporting to deliver resilient and survivable weapon systems. Improved automation will enable the analysis of products from engineering, Test $amp;amp; Evaluation, and other assessments to proactively identify areas of risk (e.g. compromised software, unsecure configurations, supply chain vulnerabilities, etc). Enhancements will be leveraged to develop specific remediation plans/actions for priority findings from the DoD Security Cooperation Program and other defensive cyberspace operations in order to deliver fixes at mission relevant speeds. FY 2026 Plans: ASA(ALT) will continue to address cyber vulnerability trends and crosscutting remediations to deliver resilient and survivable weapon systems. This includes continued oversight of ongoing and development of new strategies for recent and ongoing Strategic Cybersecurity Program evaluations. Additionally, CORA-P will synergize findings and remediation actions from multiple Army and DoD sensitive initiatives to Mitigate Critical Vulnerabilities across critical capabilities.
