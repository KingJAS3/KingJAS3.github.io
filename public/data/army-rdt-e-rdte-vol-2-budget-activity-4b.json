These capabilities will enable rapid and responsive all-domain targeting applications required to engage and defeat A2/AD forces and enable force projection and freedom of maneuver in contested Multi-Domain Operations and continue to inform the Army and Joint Services Family of Integrated Targeting Cells (FITC).

It will enable Warfighters at echelon to conduct C2 of counter surveillance and reconnaissance operations and to dynamically task, receive and disseminate data to directly support live-fire S2S demonstrations and assessments. FY 2025 Plans: Battle Management and Control (BMC2) and ground infrastructure continues the demonstration and validation of ground architecture, evaluating the ability to provide wide-area, responsive, and deep-area sensing required for Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) targeting and force maneuver, significantly reducing Sensor-to-Shooter (S2S) timelines. Ground architecture is evaluated through multiple assessment events including the Assured Position, Navigation, Timing and Space (APNT/S) Cross Functional Team (CFT) Campaign of Learning and Army Futures Command's Capstone Exercise. These provide a realistic operational environment to evaluate the integrated Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), BMC2, and communications data to identify and locate targets of interest in denied and contested environments actionable by the tactical warfighter. This is executed through the S2S demonstration and experimentation plan which began with the first Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Assessment Exercise (PNTAX) in FY19. PNTAX provides the Army's sole large scale, open air, threat informed Radio Frequency/Global Positioning System denied environment for assessments and experiments necessary to ensure evolution of Multi-Domain Operations and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities. Further, APNT/S CFT conducts multiple CONUS-based live-fire exercises along with follow-on embedded experimentation in exercises across US Army Europe- African Command (USEUR-AF) and US Army Pacific Command (USARPAC), culminating with a FY 2025 Capstone exercise.

In addition, OWT will begin to develop advanced capabilities that allow user-generated terrain captures to be incorporated into the OWT repository and standard commercial tools and technologies to be used for geospatial data editing. Also, base funding will continue efforts to improve OWT 3D terrain data integration into the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) family of programs. FY 2026 Plans: Funding will support the continued automation of OWT feature extraction and attribution as well as program management costs. OWT will provide updated terrain data to Mapping and Cartographic Information Systems (MCIS) for map correlation to reflect pre-exercise ground conditions. In addition, OWT will begin to develop advanced capabilities that allow user-generated terrain captures to be incorporated into the OWT repository and standard commercial tools and technologies to be used for geospatial data editing. Also, base funding will continue efforts to improve OWT 3D terrain data integration into the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) family of program and STE Core Service in support of NGC development in accordance with validated STESW ICD 1QFY2025. Core Services are the set of common capabilities provided by One World Terrain (OWT). Core Services include ingestion and scaling of authoritative data sources, common models, select joint data and interoperability standards, and system architecture. Funding will establish enterprise level business processes and services enabling OWT to efficiently develop, operate, and secure capabilities in accordance with OSD Digital Engineering and Army Digital Transformations Strategies. Efforts will promote synergies between the training and testing enablers to improve product development, integration, and cyber activities, and to promote re-use of common assets and services to Army modernization priorities. FY 2025 to FY 2026 Increase/Decrease Statement: FY 2025 to FY 2026 funding increase is due to prioritization by Army leadership to accelerate the development, integration, and fielding of Next Generation Constructive (NGC) as defined by Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Software (SW) requirements. As a result, OWT will provide a significant expansion of terrain datasets, increased integration and testing, and the development of additional models to support training at higher echelons in support of the STE Family of Programs.","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col 1","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"FY 2024","type":"numeric"},{"code":"pdfc_3","label":"FY 2025","type":"numeric"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals","pdfc_1":"12.710","pdfc_2":11.35,"pdfc_3":39.075}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"millions"},{"name":"Table 395","tabPath":["Table 395"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"Exhibit R-2A, RDT$amp;amp;E Project Justification: PB 2026 Army","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col 1","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"Col 2","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_3","label":"Date: June 2025","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Appropriation/Budget Activity 2040 / 4","pdfc_1":"R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0604121A / Synthetic Training Environ ment Refinement $amp;amp; Prototyping","pdfc_2":"Project (Number/Name) CR4 / STE One World Terrain (OWT)","pdfc_3":""}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false,"dollarUnit":"thousands"},{"name":"C.
