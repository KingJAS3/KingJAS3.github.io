Perform technical assessments and concept studies for the following: electronic obsolescence mitigation, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT), crew protection, automotive and hardware/software enhancements, improving operational timelines and risk reduction. FY 2025 Plans: Continue tactical launcher software development to incorporate updates from Functional Qualification Test (FQT) and Post System Integration Test (SIT) qualification to support the fire control system (FCS). Integrate and test the improved Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities and integration of satellite communications, to include M-Code and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities. Update software to integrate evolving cybersecurity requirements. FY 2026 Plans: Completes the integration of the Increment 1 M-Code Receiver. Continues the tactical launcher software development to incorporate updates from Functional Qualification Test (FQT) and Post System Integration Test (SIT) qualification to support the fire control system (FCS), integrates and tests the improved Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities and satellite communications; including M-Code and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities. Updates software to integrate evolving cybersecurity requirements. Develop, integrate, and test rocket launcher solutions, including test planning to support test events. Initiates Increment 2, Next Generation APNT Receiver development which will replace the obsolete Increment 1 M-code receiver. Also initiates the design of the receiver electronics for the Increment 2 M-code application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Space Force. The design, testing, and qualification of the ASIC receiver is expected to take approximately four years followed by integration testing and qualification at the system level. The Increment 2 APNT Receiver effort will replace the NavStrike M receiver due to obsolescence. The Increment 2 APNT Receiver addresses the evolving threat environment. Potential advancements include efforts such as: Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV), timing holdover, Network Assisted Assured (NA2), Other Signals of Opportunity, Advanced Anti-Jam, and Beamforming.

As capability enhancements are developed, technology is inserted to mitigate obsolescence. Support efforts include: obsolescence mitigation and enhancements for the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) Carrier, fire control system, launcher loader module and Enhanced Command and Control; development and updating the Fire Control System software to keep pace with changes to the munitions; and performing Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I)/interoperability and Information Assurance compliance certification and network interoperability testing. Perform technical assessments and concept studies for the following: electronic obsolescence mitigation and redesign to keep pace with the evolving threat, Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing (APNT), crew protection, automotive and hardware/software enhancements, improving operational timelines, leader-follower technology and risk reduction. FY 2025 Plans: Continue tactical launcher software development, risk reduction, and qualification to support the fire control system (FCS) electronic obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a M142 HIMARS launcher. Integrate and test the improved Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities and satellite communications, to include M-Code and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities for CFCS-equipped M142 HIMARS launchers. Complete Digital Anti-Jam Receiver (DIGAR) testing for UFCS-equipped M142 HIMARS launchers. FY 2026 Plans: Completes the integration of the Increment 1 M-Code Receiver. Continues the tactical launcher software development to incorporate updates from Functional Qualification Test (FQT) and Post System Integration Test (SIT) qualification to support the fire control system (FCS), integrates and tests the improved Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) capabilities and satellite communications; including M-Code and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities. Updates software to integrate evolving cybersecurity requirements. Develop, integrate, and test rocket launcher solutions, including test planning to support test events. Initiates Increment 2, Next Generation APNT Receiver development which will replace the obsolete Increment 1 M-code receiver. Also initiates the design of the receiver electronics for the Increment 2 M-code application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Space Force. The design, testing, and qualification of the ASIC receiver is expected to take approximately four years followed by integration testing and qualification at the system level. The Increment 2 APNT Receiver effort will replace the NavStrike M receiver due to obsolescence. The Increment 2 APNT Receiver addresses the evolving threat environment. Potential advancements include efforts such as: Alternative Navigation (ALTNAV), timing holdover, Network Assisted Assured (NA2), Other Signals of Opportunity, Advanced Anti-Jam, and Beamforming.

The FTI project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis/risk mitigation and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce costs by providing competition and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect, identify, and correct latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues and add capabilities. FY 2025 Plans: Analysis/Risk Mitigation: Expand and refine the fuze critical components database to identify and mitigate obsolescence as well as single point components and processes; complete the proximity sensor Hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) countermeasures testing infrastructure; and continue to integrate miniature reserve cell batteries for use in 30mm to 40mm medium caliber fuzes. Block Upgrade: Complete extended duration artillery fuze power sources; investigate M734A1 signal processor product improvement; continue to integrate electronic and energetic technologies into the M213 hand grenade fuze to increase fuze and explosive safety; completes updating the M82 66mm smoke grenade with an electronic delay.
