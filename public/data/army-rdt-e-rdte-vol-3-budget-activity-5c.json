When fully deployed, ArmyIgnitED will be used by approximately 1.4 million end users at both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the CONUS (OCONUS) locations. It will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide TA, CA, and reimbursement management software system. ArmyIgnitED develops a more educated workforce which strengthens the recruiting and retention effort. ArmyIgnitED is the virtual financial management portal and decision-support tool for 1) Active Duty (AD), US Army Reserves (USAR), and Army National Guard (ARNG) Soldiers to request TA; 2) Cadets to request scholarship payments and 3) Department of the Army (DA) civilians and apprentices to request professional development funds. ArmyIgnitED is hosted in the Air Force (AF) Cloud One and leverages Automated Education Management System (AFAEMS) code base as a Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solution. Development maximizes re-configuration of the Air Force Voluntary Education platform, AFAEMS, to the greatest extent possible and performing only minimal necessary modifications to ensure implementation of Army laws, policies, regulations, and directives (LPRDs). FY 2025 Plans: FY 2025 supports the Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) phase. Capability enhancements include: Recoupments $amp;amp; Refunds from students and academic institutions, which will make the system possible to reclaim millions of dollars in funding annually; Expanding the GFEBS interface to accommodate additional transactions and lead greater efficiency and auditability; A new interface with Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) as the authoritative data source to retrieve required data; Basic Skills Education Program (BSEP) entry capability to comply with Vocational educational Management Information System (VEMIS) reporting requirements; Desk Audits. FY 2026 Plans: FY 2026 will continue to support the CI/CD phase. Planned capability enhancements include: Interfaces with Army Career Tracker (ACT), Academic Degree Training (ADT), Joint Service Transcript (JST), Interactive Media Instruction (IMI), Education Center Testing, and Institutional Delivered Credential (IDC). FY 2025 to FY 2026 Increase/Decrease Statement: FY 2026 funding decreases by $1.556 million due to reduced enhancement requirements during the CI/CD phase.","pdfc_1":null,"pdfc_2":2.93,"pdfc_3":1.374}},{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Title: Regional Level Application Software (RLAS)","pdfc_1":0.536,"pdfc_2":0.305,"pdfc_3":null}}],"totalRows":2,"truncated":false},{"name":"Table 388","tabPath":["Table 388"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"Exhibit R-2A, RDT$amp;amp;E Project Justification: PB 2026 Army","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_1","label":"Col 1","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_2","label":"Col 2","type":"text"},{"code":"pdfc_3","label":"Date: June 2025","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"code":null,"type":"data","cells":{"RowText":"Appropriation/Budget Activity 2040 / 5","pdfc_1":"R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013A / Information Technology Dev elopment","pdfc_2":"Project (Number/Name) 099 / Army Human Resource System","pdfc_3":""}}],"totalRows":1,"truncated":false},{"name":"Table 389","tabPath":["Table 389"],"columns":[{"code":"RowText","label":"Description: The United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of three modules: Training, Personnel, and Resource Management. R$amp;amp;D authority and funding will meet the USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R$amp;amp;D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A) interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements. FY 2025 Plans: Integrated Personnel Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) release for Personnel did not fully subsume Legacy RLAS for Personnel requirements. Legacy RLAS will maintain these personnel components within the Personnel Module of RLAS to support until such time it is subsumed by IPPS-A. RLAS still maintains Resource Management modules and Training Module in support of RLAS Order Writer processing Annual Training (AT), School, and Active Duty Operational Support - Reserve Component (ADOSRC) for Active Duty Orders; and Inactive Duty Training (Battle Assembly and Additional Drill Assembly types) for Army Reserve Soldiers. RLAS also provides support to USARC G8 Pay Management Division (PMD) to support Military Pay processing with system interfacing between Defense Joint Military Pay System - Reserve Component and RLAS for Reserve Component Troop Program Unit members. The delay in IPPS-A release of Personnel in November of 2022 shifted funding requirements to maintain the Legacy RLAS as a Financial Feeder System. FY 2025 Base funds will support increased functionality and interface solutions between RLAS and Integrated Personnel Pay System - Army (IPPS-A).

SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army's business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft Office 365 environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage , and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks. FY 2025 Plans: Funds are used to sustain technology refresh efforts ensuring the Army's records comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, preserves individual record integrity, mitigates the risk of historical information loss, and ensures official Army records are available for Congressional, Government Accountability Office, Executive Branch, and FOIA requirements. We fund contractor man-years to sustain this system through an IT Services contract. FY 2026 Plans: The Army Records Management and Declassification programs are in needed of this funding to modernize the Army-wide records through application software development that will enhance efficiency, accessibility, security, and scalability. More specifically, the goal is to obtain application software that can automate manual record-keeping processes, reducing human errors, and streamline workflows. Through modernization, we can access records through cloud-based solutions or mobile applications. This accessibility ensures that authorized personnel can retrieve, update, and analyze records from various locations, improving collaboration, and decision-making. Army records that contain sensitive information must be safeguarded against unauthorized access and breaches. Through the use of information technology/modernized software, the Army can continue to implement and strengthen security measures such as encryption, access controls, and audit trails to protect data integrity and confidentiality. As the Army (electronic) records continue to grow or record-keeping needs continue to expand. Application software designed for Army-wide scalability is needed to accommodate increasing volumes of data and users without sacrificing performance or reliability. This investment in modernized software can help ensure compliance with public law/statutes and regulations by automating compliance checks, generating audit reports, and maintaining and safeguarding comprehensive records for the entire Army. Through continuously funding, the Army will be able to modernize it records programs through application software development allowing the Army to effectively manage their data/records assets, improve operational efficiency, mitigate risks, and stay competitive in today's digital environment.

Additionally ATIS will improve resource utilization, reduce manual errors through the use of automation in testing and integration, and ensure increased efficiency over time through the use of iterative processes. Additionally, in FY25 ATIS will continue to address the refined backlog of Agile work artifacts which will deliver the requirements as prioritized, and reduce risks associated with usability. Finally, ATIS will award multiple prototype contracts, leading to a down-select award of a production contract. FY 2026 Plans: FY 2026 RDTE Base dollars in the amount of $10.970 million will enable ATIS to sunset the Digital Training Management System (DTMS) in 2QFY26. DTMS is the largest component of the Army Training Management System (ATMS) and its features will be delivered in continuous integrated releases of capability in accordance with Agile Project Management's Continuous Integration/ Continuous Development (CI/CD) model.

Through CIMS, the DACID and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE information technology assets and other external data sources, and providing a full range of law enforcement functions. The primary component of CIMS is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions, as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. Automatic, electronic data transfers between ALERTS and Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) are being established to provide historical, up-to-date information assisting in agent hiring procedures. The Accreditations module of CIMS was developed from a stand-alone to an enterprise application providing access to multiple DACID personnel. The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) electronic feed was updated incorporating FBI standards providing accurate DNA and fingerprint data.

Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting ARFORGEN capabilities. FY 2025 Plans: In FY 2025, the Explosives Safety Management Module is being developed as a component within the SOH Program Management module. This capability will encompass all aspects of explosives safety to include explosives site plan management, storage, disposal, and all workflows necessary to support those activities across the Army. We are also completing the SOH Training and Education module as the fifth key module of the ASMIS 2.0 family of systems. FY 2026 Plans: In FY 2026, two capabilities are scheduled for implementation. Both of them are major deliverables and each brings benefit to the Army: 1. ASMIS 2.0 Occupational Health/Medical Surveillance module. This module is the final of six distinct capabilities within the ASMIS 2.0 family of systems. It enables the Army to track and measure exposure to hazards that exist as the result of an individual's job series, location, and nature of work. This element of Occupational Health is not currently supported across the Army and we are therefore unable to effectively track medical appointments that occur to either prevent exposures or treat exposures after the fact. The ability to measure and track these events, their impact to Army Safety $amp;amp; Occupational Health (SOH), and the cost incurred by the Army as a result is a critical element of management of the Army's SOH program, as directed via the DoDi 6055-01 and AR 385-10. 2. ASMIS 2.0 Safety $amp;amp; Occupational Health Expense and Budget Management. The Deputy Assistance Secretary of the Army for Environmental Safety and Occupational Health (DASA ESOH) is responsible for tracking all expenditures for Safety $amp; Occupational Health related expenditures across the Army annually to support planning and oversight of the abatement of hazards and other unsafe conditions. Currently, there is not an integrated, centralized capability that enables this tracking at the Army level. This capability will allow agencies and units to report these expenditures, track them to their annual budgets, and this data will automatically aggregate, regardless of PEG or MDEP, to enable

The JTNC provides technical expertise to facilitate tactical communications management, innovation, and standardization. The JTNC: (1) maintains a cyber-hardened DoD Information Repository (IR), (2) provides Technical Analyses/Capability Characterizations on tactical communications products, (3) provides Open Systems Architecture Standards, (4) provides exportability analysis and licensing reviews, and (5) serves as Technical Advisor to the Communications, Command, and Control Leadership Board (C3LB) and Tactical Communications Senior Steering Group (TCSSG). The Joint Tactical Networking Center aligns with Army 2030/40 priorities. FY 2025 Plans: JTNC will continue to serve as Chair of the Communications Waveforms and Technologies Working Group (CTWWG), supporting both TCSSG and C3LB efforts towards managing Joint warfighter challenges and fielding tactical communications solutions. JTNC will continue technical analysis efforts for C3LB approved waveforms, in accordance with Service priorities and the FY 2025 JTNC Management Plan. The JTNC will continue to support both the Services and Principal Staff Assistant (DoD CIO) in oversight of Lead Service activities as Technical Advisor, assisting in the identification and resolution of cross-service networking disconnects. The JTNC will remain engaged in Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) Operational Planning Teams/ systems engineering support across the Services. The JTNC, through the efforts of the CTWWG's Resiliency Sub-Working Group, will coordinate and socialize resiliency terminology, processes, and support resources to design, test, compare, and field tactical radio products most capable of mitigating adversary detection, interception, geolocation, and jamming threats. The JTNC will continue managing and maintaining the DoD Information Repository (IR), providing controlled access for proprietary and nonproprietary waveforms and associated tactical communications products. The JTNC will enhance DoD IR capabilities by evolving framework compliance and Cloud migration. The JTNC will continue Joint Communications Marketplace (JCM) development to meet DoD and Industry requirements in conjunction with DoD Instruction 4630.09. The JTNC will manage evolution of the JCM to provide value-added collaborative environment tools, enabling Government and Industry to share information on innovative technologies and DoD capability gaps leading to rapid acquisition efforts to meet warfighter needs.
