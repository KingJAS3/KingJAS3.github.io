The Army identifies existing technology, often available commercially, to further develop and modify for Army use. Partnerships with industry both traditional and non-traditional, allow the Army to advance non-military commercial research and development investments through focused engagements resulting in commercial adaption and integration to address Army technology and modernization efforts. Initial nominal Army investment in proof of technology and technology demonstrations will expedite novel technologies shaping their development to meet Army requirements and expediting both component and complete system adaptation.

It will fuse local data processing and payload data to increase accuracy for target engagement, optimize data dissemination algorithms based on local network conditions, and streamline interfaces for small units to access joint strike assets. FY 2025 Plans: Will demonstrate novel mission planning approaches leveraging real-time situational awareness of the battlespace. Will provide software demonstration of initial threat alert concept using simulation data.
